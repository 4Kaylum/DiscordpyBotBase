# VoxelBotUtils

VoxelBotUtils is a package for extending the Discord.py library, intending to make creating bots just a lil bit faster by dealing with the overhead, like config files, help commands, and a bunch of more common utils like `TimeValue`. 

# Usage

This package is intended to be used via the commandline as a module. Running `py -m voxelbotutils --create-config-file` will create a default config file for you, and running `py -m voxelbotutils .` will run the current folder as a bot, using data in `config/config.toml` and loading the cogs from `cogs/*`.

# Docs

TBA.

# Installing

The package is available via pypi - `pip install voxelbotutils` - but this package will always be further up-to-date with experimental or incomplete features should you wish to use that.
